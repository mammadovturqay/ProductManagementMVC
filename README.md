# ProductManagementMVC

This project is an ASP.NET Core MVC application designed to manage a list of products. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete products (CRUD operations) without using a database or JSON files. Instead, the data is stored in a static list within the controller. The application features basic validation and user interactions are handled using JavaScript.

## Features

   - Displays a list of all products with their name, description, price, and discount.
   - Each product entry includes links to view details, edit, and delete the product.

2. **Product Details**
   - Shows detailed information about a specific product.

3. **Create Product**
   - Allows users to add a new product to the list.
   - The new product form includes fields for name, description, price, and discount.

4. **Edit Product**
   - Provides a form to update an existing productâ€™s information.

5. **Delete Product**
   - Allows users to delete a product from the list.
   - Deletion is handled via JavaScript, which sends a POST request to the server to remove the product.
